title: About Che-Wei Chang

I am currently a PhD student in the Group of Crop Biodiversity and Breeding Informatics  (https://evoplant.uni-hohenheim.de/index.html) at the University of Hohenheim, Germany.  
My research topics focus on the local adaptation of wild barley and the implementation of genomic prediction in barley breeding.  
  
This personal web page is used to record what I learn from my study.
