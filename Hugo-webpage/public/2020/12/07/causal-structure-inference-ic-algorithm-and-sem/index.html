<h2>Why we study causal structure of traits?</h2>
<p>In a biological system, one trait may contribute to another and result in a complex pathway network. If causal relationships exist, we can expect that unselected traits will change when we select specific traits. We can use this feature to indirectly improve a target trait that is difficult or expensive to measure or has low heritability. Also, this feature may cause an undesirable change in traits that we want to maintain. Therefore, understanding causal structures can be helpful for us to define our breeding strategies.</p>
<p>I would briefly introduce a framework of causal structure analysis consisting of structural equation models and inductive causation algorithm based on <span class="citation">Valente et al. (2010)</span> and <span class="citation">Inoue (2020)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>To perform causal structure analysis by using this framework, please see the book chapter of <span class="citation">Valente and Rosa (2013)</span> for detailed tutorials.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="structural-equation-models-sem" class="section level2">
<h2>Structural equation models (SEM)</h2>
<p>Here, we first introduce the structural equation models <span class="citation">(SEM; Wright 1921; Haavelmo 1943)</span>, which allows the inference of causal coefficients. To fit SEMs, a known causal relationship is required. However, we usually have no prior knowledge or very limited knowledge of causal structures. In this situation, we need to recover a causal network by using Bayesian network (BN) learning algorithms. In the next section, we will look at the inductive causation (IC) algorithm, which has been used in several animal studies.</p>
<p>A SEM with a causal structure for subject <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (assuming <span class="math inline">\(i = 1\ ...\ n\)</span>) can be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(y_i=\Lambda y_i+X_i\beta +Zu_i+e_i\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\((t\times t)\)</span> matrix of structural coefficients with zeroes in the diagonal and with structural coefficients in the off-diagonal. <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the number of traits. <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is a multi-trait <span class="math inline">\((t\times 1) vector\)</span> of subject <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> th; <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> represent random genetic effects and residuals (phenotypic effects are included in residuals) respectively</p>
<p>Then, we can further have:<br />
<span class="math inline">\((I-\Lambda)y_i=X_i\beta+Zu_i+e_i\)</span></p>
<p>Finally, we get<br />
<span class="math inline">\(y_i = (I-\Lambda)^{-1}X_i\beta + (I-\Lambda)^{-1}Zu_i + (I-\Lambda)^{-1}e_i\)</span></p>
<p>with a joint distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\begin{bmatrix} u_i \\ e_i \end{bmatrix} \sim N \begin{Bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix} ,\begin{bmatrix}(I-\Lambda)^{-1}G[(I-\Lambda)^{-1}]^T &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; (I-\Lambda)^{-1}R[(I-\Lambda)^{-1}]^T\end{bmatrix} \end{Bmatrix}= N \begin{Bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix} ,\begin{bmatrix}G&#39; &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; R&#39;\end{bmatrix}\end{Bmatrix}\)</span></p>
<p>We extend equation to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> subjects:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(y = (I-\Lambda\otimes I_n)^{-1}X\beta + (I-\Lambda\otimes I_n)^{-1}Zu + (I-\Lambda\otimes I_n)^{-1}e\)</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(\begin{bmatrix} u \\ e \end{bmatrix} \sim N \begin{Bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix} ,\begin{bmatrix}G&#39;\otimes A &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; R&#39;\otimes I_n\end{bmatrix}\end{Bmatrix}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a genetic relationship matrix.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Gianola and Sorensen (2004)</span> suggested a Bayesian framework for the SEM inference. Please look at their paper <span class="citation">(Gianola and Sorensen 2004)</span> if you are interested in details.</p>
</div>
<div id="inductive-causation-ic-algorithm" class="section level2">
<h2>Inductive causation (IC) algorithm</h2>
<p>Conventionally, the inference of causal coefficients requires prior knowledge of phenotypes under studying. However, if causal relationships are unclear, it is not possible to perform inference. Additionaly, our inference can be limited to the known causal relationship and ignore other possibilities even if we have prior knowledge.</p>
<p>To solve the mentioned problem, <span class="citation">Valente et al. (2010)</span> implemented the IC algorithm <span class="citation">(Verma and Pearl 1990; Pearl and others 2000)</span> as a data-driven approach to indentify causal relationships. In this way, we can investigate the causal structure even if we have zero or limited prior knowledge!</p>
<div id="assumption-of-ic-algorithm" class="section level3">
<h3>(1) Assumption of IC algorithm</h3>
<p>The IC algorithm assumes that no hidden variables affect more than one of the variable, which are included in the searching process, that is, <strong>causal sufficiency assumption</strong>. We will have a misleading result if our data violates this assumption.</p>
<p>For instance, <strong>if there are observed variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> sharing a common causeal variable <code>c</code>, but <code>c</code> is unavailable in our data, this will result in a misleading edge between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the oriented graph because the IC algorithm cannot identify the correct causal structure (correlation attributes to a common hidden cause) by conditioning the correlation of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> on <code>c</code></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="confounding-effect-of-genetic-relationship" class="section level3">
<h3>(2) confounding effect of genetic relationship</h3>
<p>As genetic effects also contribute to traits, <span class="citation">Valente et al. (2010)</span> considered random genetic effects in a multiple-trait model to exclude the genetic effects on causal relationships before performing the IC algorithm.</p>
<p>A mixed model of traits can be written as what mentioned above:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(y_i = (I-\Lambda)^{-1}X_i\beta + (I-\Lambda)^{-1}Zu_i + (I-\Lambda)^{-1}e_i\)</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(\begin{bmatrix} u_i \\ e_i \end{bmatrix} \sim N \begin{Bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix} ,\begin{bmatrix}G&#39; &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; R&#39;\end{bmatrix}\end{Bmatrix}\)</span></p>
<p>Thus,<br />
<span class="math inline">\(Var(y_i) = G&#39; + R&#39;\)</span></p>
<p>By conditioning on genetic effects, we can have:<br />
<span class="math inline">\(Var(y_i|u_i) = R&#39;\)</span></p>
<p><span class="citation">Valente et al. (2010)</span> used a Bayesian method to infer the posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span> and used that posterior distribution as the input of the IC algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-does-ic-algorithm-work" class="section level3">
<h3>(3) How does IC algorithm work?</h3>
<p>The IC algorithm is aiming to generate an oriented network graph that connects traits by directed edges. Its procedure can roughly divided into three steps.</p>
<div id="step-1-identify-adjacent-variables-in-an-undirected-graph" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 1: identify adjacent variables in an undirected graph</h4>
<p>Let's assume we have three traits, <span class="math inline">\(T = \{t1, t2, t3\}\)</span>, and their true relationship is <span class="math inline">\(t1\gets t2\to t3\)</span>. Thus, we should find three traits correlate with each other (correlation coeffeicient <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{t1,t2} \ne 0; \rho_{t1,t3}\ne 0; \rho_{t2,t3}\ne 0\)</span>) but, theoretically, the partial correlation <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{t1,t3|t2} = 0\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{t1,t2|t3}\ne0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{t2,t3|t1}\ne0\)</span>.</p>
<p>With this feature, we can infer an undirected graph that <span class="math inline">\(t1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t3\)</span> are not neighbor (<span class="math inline">\(t1-t2-t3\)</span>).</p>
<p>In a real analysis, we will have more complex structure, but the general idea is the same. If we can find two variables, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, have non-zero partial correlation when conditioning on any remaining variables (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{a,b|S_{ab}}\ne 0\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S_{ab}\)</span> is a subset of variables that <span class="math inline">\(S_{ab}\notin \{a,b\}\)</span>), then we can declare the variable <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are adjacent in a network graph because no observed variable can block the correlation of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the approach of <span class="citation">Valente et al. (2010)</span>, the posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{a,b|S_{ab}}\)</span> is used to declare edges between traits. If the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals contain 0, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{a,b|S_{ab}}\)</span> is considered to be null. In practical use, different HPD thresholds usually are tested <span class="citation">(see the review of Inoue 2020)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-orient-undirected-edges-based-on-rho_abs_ab" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 2: orient undirected edges based on <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{a,b|S_{ab}}\)</span></h4>
<p>In the example we discussed here, it is easy to conclude the causal structure can be <span class="math inline">\(t1\to t2\to t3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t1\gets t2\gets t3\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(t1\gets t2\to t3\)</span> as conditioning on <span class="math inline">\(t2\)</span> can block the correlation of <span class="math inline">\(t1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t3\)</span> resulting <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{t1,t3|t2}=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot do any further inference of orientation in our case since we have no additional information to tell which causal relationship (<span class="math inline">\(t1\to t2\to t3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t1\gets t2\gets t3\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(t1\gets t2\to t3\)</span>) is correct.</p>
<p>Considering a case described by <span class="citation">Valente et al. (2010)</span>, if we find a structure <span class="math inline">\(a -c-b\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> share a common adjacent variable <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. If we cannot find any variable set <span class="math inline">\(S_{ab}\)</span> including <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> that can result in <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{a,b|S_{ab}}= 0\)</span>, we then infer <span class="math inline">\(a \to c \gets b\)</span>. Otherwise, if <span class="math inline">\(S_{ab}\)</span> exists, we infer <span class="math inline">\(a \gets c \to b\)</span> and continue to the next step.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-3-orient-undirected-edges-as-many-as-possible" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 3: orient undirected edges as many as possible</h4>
<p>If there are still undirected edges, we then need to orient them by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not create a new collider (e.g. if we have <span class="math inline">\(t1\to t2- t3\)</span>, we should orient edge as <span class="math inline">\(t1\to t2\to t3\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(t1\to t2\gets t3\)</span> because the latter creates a collider.)<br />
</li>
<li>Do not create a cycle according to the assumption of directed acyclic graphs (DAG).<br />
</li>
<li>Use your prior knowledge regarding traits.</li>
