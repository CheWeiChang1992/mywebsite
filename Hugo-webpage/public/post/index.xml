      <description>Why we use two-stage analysis? In plant breeding program, candidate genotypes may be tested in multiple environments, e.g. locations and years, to reliably evaluate quantitative traits. Data obtained from multi-environmental trials (MET) is typically analyzed by using mixed models that provide best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) and best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs).
A standard approach to analyze MET data is by fitting all fixed and random effect with one stage, called single stage analysis.</description>
