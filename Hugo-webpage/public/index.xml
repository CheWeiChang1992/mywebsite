      <description>From the breeder&#39;s aspect, BLUP (best linear unbiased predictor) is commonly used for selection because it maximizes the probability of correct ranking (Searle and McCulloch 2001, chap. 9, p.254).
On the other hand, using BLUEs (best linear unbiased estimators) of genotypes as response variables for association mapping or genomic prediction has been a conventional approach, but the reason for using BLUEs instead of BLUPs is unclear to me and not explained in the most of papers I found.</description>

      <description>I am currently a PhD student in the Group of Crop Biodiversity and Breeding Informatics (https://evoplant.uni-hohenheim.de/index.html) at the University of Hohenheim, Germany.
My research topics focus on the local adaptation of wild barley and the implementation of genomic prediction in barley breeding.
This personal web page is used to record what I learn from my study.

      <title>Two-stage analysis to compute BLUPs</title>

      <description>Why we use two-stage analysis? In plant breeding program, candidate genotypes may be tested in multiple environments, e.g. locations and years, to reliably evaluate quantitative traits. Data obtained from multi-environmental trials (MET) is typically analyzed by using mixed models that provide best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) and best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs).
A standard approach to analyze MET data is by fitting all fixed and random effect with one stage, called single stage analysis.</description>
