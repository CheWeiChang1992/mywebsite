      <description>I am is currently a PhD student in the Group of Crop Biodiversity and Breeding Informatics (https://evoplant.uni-hohenheim.de/index.html) at the University of Hohenheim, Germany.
My research project focuses on the local adaptation of wild barley and the implementation of genomic prediction in barley breeding.
This personal web page is used to record what I learn.

      <description>Why we use two-stage analysis? In plant breeding program, candidate genotypes may be tested in multiple environments, e.g. locations and years, to reliably evaluate quantitative traits. Data obtained from multi-environmental trials (MET) is typically analyzed by using mixed models that provide best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) and best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs).
A standard approach to analyze MET data is by fitting all fixed and random effect with one stage, called single stage analysis.</description>
